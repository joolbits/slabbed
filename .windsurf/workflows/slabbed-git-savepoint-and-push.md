# Slabbed Git Savepoint and Push (delegate)

Use the skill instead of duplicating steps:

1) Invoke skill: `slabbed-git-savepoint-and-push` (handles status → build gate → intentional stage → commit → optional tag/push with guardrails).
2) Follow any prompts from the skill; it already enforces preconditions and stop condition.
