## [0.2.0-beta.1-hotfix.1]
### Fixed
- Restored stable selection outline/hitbox behavior for slab-supported functional blocks.
- Removed experimental/debug instrumentation (no [SHAPES]/[RAYCAST_EMPTY]/DIAG_FALLBACK/CrosshairTargetRedirectMixin/RaycastShapeDebugMixin on this hotfix line).

### Known issues
- Ghosting in complex slab+block stacking remains; not addressed in this hotfix.

## [0.1.1-alpha]
### Added / Changed
- Sodium-compatible rendering: FRAPI quad vertex translation so block models visually align with slab top surfaces (no Indigo/Indium required).
- Generic model wrapping approach: slab Y-offset determined at render time via SlabSupport single-source-of-truth.

### Fixed
- Torch + common block model visual alignment on slab tops under Sodium.

### Known issues
- Redstone on slabs: visual/connection edge cases remain (down-step and power propagation still under investigation).
- Hanging support under top slabs: needs explicit in-game verification/triage for any remaining blocks beyond lanterns.
